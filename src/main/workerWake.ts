/**
 * WorkerWakeWatchdog — main-process inbox-wake watchdog for worker agents (#151).
 *
 * The renderer's idle inbox-wake nudge (useHive.ts effect #3) is the ONLY wake
 * path for a worker that has gone quiet at its prompt: it polls on a setInterval
 * in the renderer, so a throttled/occluded window (Chromium suspends background
 * setInterval timers) can miss the moment mail lands and the worker then sits on
 * an undrained inbox forever — the orchestrator ("god") never has this problem
 * because the main process re-engages it on its own heartbeat cadence.
 *
 * This watchdog is the worker-side counterpart: on a cadence it finds live
 * workers that are genuinely idle, have undrained inbox mail, are not paused /
 * not awaiting a human decision, and have not been nudged recently — then types
 * the same guarded nudge the renderer would have, directly into the PTY.
 *
 * Safety mirrors the renderer's guarded queue-drain (useHive.ts dispatch):
 *  - only a GENUINELY idle worker is nudged (no PTY output for IDLE_MS — the
 *    same quiescence the renderer's idle fallback uses), never a mid-turn one,
 *  - never inside the boot sequence (BOOT_GRACE_MS from spawn, mirroring the
 *    renderer's bootGraceUntil),
 *  - delivery paused / agent paused / halted → no nudge (ControlRegistry),
 *  - a recent permission/HITL notification re-arms a block (HITL_REARM_MS) so a
 *    prompt the human is deciding on is never typed into,
 *  - a per-worker cooldown (NUDGE_COOLDOWN_MS) so the watchdog and the renderer
 *    nudge don't stack on top of each other.
 *
 * Deliberately the renderer's own nudge text, and the same type pattern the
 * renderer's submitToPty uses (text first, Enter as a separate keystroke).
 *
 * No electron import — unit-testable (mirrors ControlRegistry).
